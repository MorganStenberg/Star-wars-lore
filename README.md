# Planning and design

The website was planned and designed to give and authenic Star Wars feeling with the right colors and background image. It was also intended to be easy to use and give immediate feedback to the user, via colors and text. As well as excluding any extra pages and having all the content beeing manipulated and displayed on one page to increase swiftness and user experience. 

## Wireframes 

The first design of the website was planned with a simple hierarchy, with the main game area taking up most of the space and the logo and footer placed to the top left and bottom right respectively. As seen on the wireframes below. 

This was changed while building the website, to a design where both the header (with the logo) and the game area with questions and answers were centered on the page. While the footer is still kept to the bottom right of the page.
